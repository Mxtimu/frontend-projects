# Frontend Projects 


This repository contains a progressive collection of *24 frontend development projects, ranging from simple layouts to advanced interactive UIs — all built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*.

Each project is organized into its own folder with a dedicated README.md, clean codebase, and commit history. The goal is to simulate real-world development workflows using Git branches, pull requests, and code reviews — making this repo a practical learning ground for both frontend skills and team-based collaboration.

# Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)
- JavaScript (DOM, Events, Components)
- Git & GitHub (branching, pull requests, reviews)

# Objectives

- Practice frontend fundamentals with hands-on projects
- Apply Git workflows used in real development teams
- Build a solid and reviewable project history for your portfolio
- Learn and grow incrementally — each project builds on the last

# Collaboration

Each project is built in its own feature branch and reviewed by a peer developer before being merged into main. This encourages thoughtful coding, clear documentation, and professional practices.

# Project List
when you go to roadmap.sh than go to frontend projects, I will be doing all these projects daily, aiming to learn and better understand programming. i will add my own projects like maybe design a wire frame on figma than attempt to bring it to life with programming.
